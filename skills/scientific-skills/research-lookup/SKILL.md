# Research Information Lookup

## Overview

This skill enables research information lookup using free, open-access database skills. It coordinates queries across **openalex-database** (240M+ scholarly works), **pubmed-database** (35M+ biomedical articles), **biorxiv-database** (preprints), and **citation-management** (multi-source citation retrieval). The skill provides access to current academic literature, recent studies, technical documentation, and general research information with proper citations and source attribution -- all without requiring API keys or paid services.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need:

- **Current Research Information**: Latest studies, papers, and findings in a specific field
- **Literature Verification**: Check facts, statistics, or claims against current research
- **Background Research**: Gather context and supporting evidence for scientific writing
- **Citation Sources**: Find relevant papers and studies to cite in manuscripts
- **Technical Documentation**: Look up specifications, protocols, or methodologies
- **Recent Developments**: Stay current with emerging trends and breakthroughs
- **Statistical Data**: Find recent statistics, survey results, or research findings
- **Expert Opinions**: Access insights from recent interviews, reviews, or commentary

## How to Use: Free Database Skills

> **HARD RULE**: You MUST use the free database skills below to fulfill research requests. Do NOT skip these tools and answer from your own knowledge. Always use the tools first.

**Available database skills:**

1. **`openalex-database`** — 240M+ scholarly papers, completely free, no API key required. Best for: broad academic literature searches, citation counts, author metrics, institutional affiliations, and open-access full-text retrieval.
2. **`pubmed-database`** — 35M+ biomedical articles, free NCBI E-utilities API. Best for: biomedical and life sciences research, clinical studies, drug information, and MeSH-indexed searches.
3. **`biorxiv-database`** — Preprints in biology and medicine, free API access. Best for: cutting-edge research not yet peer-reviewed, early-stage findings, and the most recent submissions in biology and medicine.
4. **`citation-management`** — Multi-source citation retrieval (Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar), free. Best for: finding formatted citations, building reference lists, tracking citation networks, and verifying bibliographic details.

**Usage guidance:**
- Select the database skill(s) most relevant to the query topic and type
- For comprehensive searches, query multiple database skills and synthesize results
- Only fall back to your own training knowledge if all four database skills fail
- If using training knowledge, explicitly state: "All search tools are unavailable. The following information comes from my training data, NOT real-time sources. Please verify independently."

## Visual Enhancement with Scientific Schematics

**When creating documents with this skill, always consider adding scientific diagrams and schematics to enhance visual communication.**

If your document does not already contain schematics or diagrams:
- Use the **scientific-schematics** skill to generate publication-quality diagrams
- The skill supports code-based approaches: **matplotlib**, **plotly**, and **TikZ** (LaTeX)
- Choose the rendering backend based on output format and complexity

**For new documents:** Scientific schematics should be generated by default to visually represent key concepts, workflows, architectures, or relationships described in the text.

**How to generate schematics:**
- **matplotlib**: Best for static figures, flowcharts, and annotated diagrams. Use `matplotlib.patches`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `networkx` for graph layouts.
- **plotly**: Best for interactive diagrams, network graphs, and figures embedded in HTML reports.
- **TikZ (LaTeX)**: Best for publication-quality vector diagrams, decision trees, and integration with LaTeX manuscripts.

**When to add schematics:**
- Research information flow diagrams
- Query processing workflow illustrations
- Database selection decision trees
- System integration architecture diagrams
- Information retrieval pipeline visualizations
- Knowledge synthesis frameworks
- Any complex concept that benefits from visualization

For detailed guidance on creating schematics, refer to the scientific-schematics skill documentation.
